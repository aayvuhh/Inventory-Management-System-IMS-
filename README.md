An inventory management system is a software application designed to handle and monitor all activities 
related to stock and inventory within a business. It helps the inventory manager or staff to maintain a real-time 
database of available items, purchased goods, and sold products along with their quantities and values. This system 
automates the tracking of stock levels, product details, supplier information, and order history. 
The system maintains accurate records of items added, issued, or returned, and ensures that the stock does 
not fall below minimum levels. It also tracks reorder levels, calculates the cost of goods, and manages supplier details 
for replenishment. Users can search for items instantly, update stock information, generate purchase orders, and 
prepare reports efficiently. 
The purpose of the inventory management system is to provide timely, accurate, and systematic data on 
stock and supplies, helping businesses reduce wastage, avoid shortages, optimize inventory costs, and save 
significant time and effort.
